			<h3>Useless Corporate Training</h3>
			<span class="time-span">(2005 - 2011)</span>
			<p>
				Sat chained to a laptop screen for countless hours, clicking through computer-based-training courses which I don't remember. Attained expert status in TPS reports and some other compliance or process or something that I don't recall. Endured much suffering.

			<h3>Rabbinical College of America</h3>

				Learned awesome stuff, like Jewish law, mysticism, and more. Found out who to talk to to find an affordable diamond ring for my wife. Grew a beard that ZZ Top would be proud of.
